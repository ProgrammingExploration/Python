Part 1)
1) Get 5 Inputs
2) Put them all in a set
3) Print out the set
4) Remove One value, the value should be input
5) Ask for another value, add that to the set
6) Print this set out

Challenge - {
    Instead of getting strings get integers from the input
    For loop through the set and print each integer plus 2
} (Not Mandatory)

Part 2)
7) Create another set with random values, do not have to be input
8) Find the difference between them, and print the set out
9) Find the sum of both of them and print it out
10) Find what values are in both sets and print that out
